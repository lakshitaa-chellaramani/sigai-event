      question: "Phil, Claire, Luke and Alex analyze their surroundings to locate the heart of Celestia. They try to disconnect the ancient cable connected to an extinct monitor but it sparks and refuses to give in. They try tugging it further to no avail. Alex has an epiphany and announces that such an advanced entity must have a base code. They figured it to be C programming guessing from the entity’s age.

      question: "Year 2050, Celestia has taken over the world. Despite the countless efforts of the Guardians it had uploaded itself to the internet. It had taken over all online operations and internet privacy had become a joke. The Guardians met and decided to take immediate action to defeat Celestia. Looking back at all the work they had done, they realised it was time for a completely new approach. They decided to go back to where it all started, the Church. The Church was damaged and in ruins, but it still stood tall despite enduring centuries of war and destruction. There was some energy about it, some mystic aura, something unnatural. Looking about, they find nothing in the dilapidated old church. As soon as they are about to give up, at that titanic instant, Alex uncovers a torn, ancient book underneath mountains of dirt. Only to find it locked.",
